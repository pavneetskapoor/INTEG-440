    "#### Twitter REST API \n",
    "Twitter's REST API is well suited for a conversational manner between client and server where it follows the typical request and response paradigm. REST APIs are stateless in nature and provide more flexibility in regards to the types of query for clients and respective data that servers provide. The server holds context only to the immediate request made within the request sent and sends respective data. In comparison to the streaming API, the REST API accounts for a more powerful query method and can capture up to 400 keyword phrases under a 15 request per minute protocol.(http://140dev.com/twitter-api-programming-tutorials/aggregating-tweets-search-api-vs-streaming-api/)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Twitter Streaming API\n",
    "Twitter's streaming API sends data in real time where the server is constantly sending data over to the client given the connection is open among the two. Streaming APIs essentially send data over to the client each time an update is is made rather than the traditional request and response state-based model. Where there is less of a conversation between client and server, Streaming APIs are less flexible in their structure of their data and provide a pre-defined structure of data to the client. Once a connection is opened betweent the streaming API, that is the lone connection that allows for data to be sent to the client. The default access level allows up to 400 track keywords, 5,000 follow userids and 25 0.1-360 degree location boxes as per Twitter's documentation (https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/filter-realtime/api-reference/post-statuses-filter) One article mentions about 3000 tweets a minute and returns 100 tweets per search. \n",

In the for loop statement, tweepy takes care of pagination through a Cursor object which allows us to focus on handling the type of results coming back. Based on the parameters specified, we're looking for all the latest 200 tweets (including replies) that the user has posted and the full text within the tweet using `tweet_mode = \"extended\"` Within the for loop, a dictionary is created to house all the relevant data for the tweet including: `text, tweet_id, retweet_count, fav_count, user_id, user_screen_name, time, hashtags, user_mentions`. If there is an account for user meta data, then include: `location, user_description, user_url`. Using RegEx, any sort of strings that encompass the http[s]://** pattern will be tagged to a `links_in_tweet` key and finally the link to the tweet is included within the dict object. Then, 200 tweets, all as dict objects within the list are returned to the user."

    "\n",
    "Many tweets contain links to other tweets, and to content external to Twitter. There is potentially a lot of interesting and useful information that we can gather from these links, but we have to do some extra work to get it. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we need to identify links in the tweets themselves. There are a number of ways to do this, including using a regular expression (which we do in one of the custom functions below). The resulting links have been shortened by Twitter (e.g. [https://t.co/RmUDsFf3em](https://t.co/RmUDsFf3em). In order to know what content a Tweet is linking to, we need to tell Python to follow the link. This will trigger a redirect to the linked content. We can then tell Python to tell us what the *actual* link is. Finally, we can use a package like `tldextract` to parse the actual link and return the top-level domain (e.g. Twitter, the New York Times, etc.). \n",

    "`process_urls` function will take in a string url parameter and return a dictionary object containing data related to the url provided and it's attributes: `valid_url, domain, subdomain, suffix`. First, the try statement captures the attempt to be redirected to the link contained within the tweet and the URL is stored within the `redirected` key alongside being linked as a `yes` to `valid_url`. If there is an exception caused from the redirection, then the attempt to open the link had failed and it is not a valid url (`no` to `valid_url`). Based on the validity of the URL, then the `tldextract` package is used to parse the URL and find its associated `domain, subdomain, suffix` of the link. If the URL was not valid to begin with, all the aforementioned attributes will be filled accordingly to indicate an unvalid url and missing attributes. Finally the ld dict object is returned.   "

There would potentially be a variation among the links all seven party leaders frequently link to in part to their affiliation to the political viewpoints supported in favor to their party for which the frequency would be higher than other linked websites.

    "Twitter IDs are unique identifiers that differentiates one account from another. No two people will have the same ID and an ID is immutable. Twitter Screen Names can be changed if wanted (mutable) but they're associated ID to the account will not be changed ever. Since `id` will never change and is unique, you can collect more data than `screen _name`. For some of the methods in Twitter's REST API service, user or friend search is better catered towards IDs rather than screen names based on the shear size of return in the objects. For searching friends associated to a certain twitter account, a `GET/followers/ids` generates over 5,000 user IDs within a group while `GET/followers/list`only provides groups of 20 users where both have optionality for pagination. Since there is a request limit of 15 during a 15 minute span, IDs help to grab a larger set of values within a shorter amount of time for a broader set to analyze. For cross-referencing or maanipulating from a historical data set containing screen name can be confusing since the screen_name is susceptible to change in comparison to ID."

Unlike the REST API (which *pulls* data from Twitter), the Streaming API recieves data that is *pushed* from Twitter in real time. This requires defining a special listener class. The code block below defines the `MyStreamListener` class discussed in the assigned reading. Once you execute that code cell, you are ready to start recieving real time streaming data from Twitter.

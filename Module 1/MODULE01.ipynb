    "This module is a high-level introduction to the challenges and opportunities of the emerging field of computational social science. In this module and the next, we will consider some implications of the recent explosion of digital data and of increasingly powerful computational methods. We will do so while balancing two perspectives: as scientific **researchers** who get to work with exciting new data and methods with revolutionary scientific potential, and as **citizens** who are affected by the things that other people and institutions do with new data and methods. As both researchers and citizens, we have stakes in making this field as good as it can be. Following this high-level introduction, we will consider some of the specific challenges and opportunities associated with large-scale observational data, which includes nearly all data collected from the web and other digital sources. \n",

    "These issues of varying perspective on the challenges and opportunities involved in computational social science can be in attribute to the cumulation of experiences that different types of people have. A lot of these issues can be seen within the common day among large social network companies such as Facebook, who have been under fire over the years due to involvement with poltical advertising and fake news. For Facebook, their perspective was to provide an API for data outlet and usage by approved 3rd party apps but later it had become a case of scandal among analytics firms using their data with malicious intent to impose politically targeted messages. Social scientists and privacy advocates would see this as an issue of ethics around the fact of giving people's personal data to develop and manipulate perspectives of people. Another perspective would be to consider how Facebook solemly let their data to be exposed to the likes of 3rd parties and sold under the nose without thorough review of intent. I look at computational social science through the premise of a business data scientist primarily due to my exposure to the world of tech companies and manipulating big data to drive business OKRs. Through one of my current courses, machine intelligence, I'm learning how to use methodologies like t-sne, neural networks, and k-means to apply to real world problems. For the premise of my ML project, I'm looking at investigating and predicting how much funding a startup can receive in a series based on previously accumulated data. For me computational social science provides both a cool way to investigate the world we live in through the abundance of big-data but also seeing ways how companies can use big-data to better drive their causes. Companies like DarwinAI or ElementAI which use existing big-data within company markets to help growth across various laterals. As I gain more experience/exposure in the use of algorithms and how I can potentially find meaning through data, I believe I will definitely look at the world from more of a social science approach as a way to find interesting meaning through the current day world.

    "**Readymade** and **custommade** data are different in the essence that they both serve a different purpose and are different means to a different end. Readymade data is one that is already existing and is now being repurposed for another cause. An example of readymade data would be working with existing data sets on Kaggle to do research or experiments that are apart from the intended creation. Contrarily, custommade data is one that is primarily created for the intended purpose of the researcher and is essentially developed from the ground up. Readymade data sets will be fast and efficient in order to repurpose and use the data but will not provide the level of desired granurality and customization that custommade data can provide. Custommade data can be implementing new touchpoints within an application to assess user behaaviour based on the specific needs of the research. In this context, you are essentally defining the key characteristics you require of the data. The tradeoff exists between moving fast and being resourceful or getting the right data. In computational social science, readymade and custommade data play a large part in the research that is done as both can be effectively used towards finding unique insights. Researchers are able to answer unique questions and utilize both new and existing resources to inform a greater insight, which was the case for include (like here) examples"

    "#### Big\n",
    "Refers to datasets that are relatively big in scale. With big datasets, they can solve unique problems of certain types but are prone to systematic error in the course of research leading to inaccurate results within the end. Big datasets should be considered carefully and thoroughly examined in their sources. Ex: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Always-on\n",
    "Refers to a system in which data is collected over time to develop interesting research that can be used for both retrospective and present day viewpoints. However, there can be implications that occur if the inherent source for such dynamic data is also changing. Ex. of Always-on data: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nonreactive\n",
    "Is in relation to the reactivity that participants tend to exhibit during research. Participants tend to exhibit adjusted forms of behaviour or participation due to their awareness of being observed, which is not the case in big data. Due to the sheer size of data, it's intended that participants are generally not aware they're being researched which falls into subsequent issues regarding surveillance and ethics. Ex:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Incomplete\n",
    "Data that is incomplete is subject to not meeting the optimal characteristics that researchers require in order to do their proposed research. Salganik mentions three types of incompleteness in data: information on demographic of participants, their respective behavior on other platforms, and the general notion of being able to manifest theoretical constructs effectively. Ex: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Inaccessible\n",
    "A lot of data is inaccessible to researchers due to ethical and confidential barriers that are setup by governments and corporations to protect such sensitive data. These institutions can provide limited access upon request or potentially all their data under confidentiality agreements. Ex: \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Nonrepresentative\n",
    "Nonrepresentative data is data that in particular represents a larger entity or characteristic. For this particular data, its not good to make generalizations outside of the data in which the focus lies since there is no scaled entity the data represents. However, making in-sample analysis is powerful when you know what you're looking for. While observations could potentially be transportable, it is highly likely they are not because the difference in nature of sample vs population. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Drifting\n",
    "Many big-data systems within the common world are susceptible to drift in regards to population, behaviour, and system drift which makes it hard to assess data over time since the underlying measurement system is one that constantly requires change. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithmically confounded\n",
    "Is a major concern among data scientists which essentially states that nonreactive big-data or the notion of observing user action is in subject to a highly engineered environment which intentionally induces certain actions (targeted ads, casinos, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dirty\n",
    "Big-data is very often contaminated with unuseful and uninteresting data which provides no meaning to any sort of analysis. To tackle this, you must be clear in your intention of data analysis and know what to look for in order to clean your data respectively and know your data fully. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sensitive\n",
    "Sensitive data can be considered as data that the collecting institution or it's participants/customers find to be sensitive in nature to them. This sort of data is typically not disclosed unless there are certain measures taken to de-sensitize the data. However, the concept of sensitivity is subjective to the underlying principles that a government/institution holds or it's collective party of participants/customers. Sensitivity can also occur without confirmed consent from users which presents an array of ethical concerns on it's own. Ex:  "

    "### Counting things\n",
    "Looking for research in the context of counting, a core fundamental in research, that is important or interesting are the key drivers for conducting research that has measurable or actionable impact. Counting can be done in various different ways but it's the matter of counting the right things in order to find patterns of meaning. This can be done in an efficient way through the process of supervised learning, ie. labelling a small set of data to help infer the larger set of data through machine learning models.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Forecasting and nowcasting\n",
    "Forecasting is still a very developing part of social research and holds a fair share of cons since predicting the future is difficult. By combining methodologies of forecasting and data to measure the current state of the world, \"nowcasting\" can be employed as a means of analysis for accurate estimates of things that are going on right now. However, you must be wary of the methodologies implemented with big-data and correctly assessed in considering all edge cases in order to develop accurate measurements. Any measurements that are lagged by time due to processing and cleaning can be more accurately processed through the use of forecasting methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Approximating experiments\n",
    "To deal with non-experimental data, two strategies can be employed in regards to big-data which are natural experiments and matching. With logical reasoning and non-experimental approaches, you can implement these in order to develop randomized controlled experiments. Where people are randomly assigned a certain treatment based on some natural event, researchers can design control groups and measure based on treatment to uncover new insights to inform new insight between groups. With big-data you can uncover important issues like heterogenerity and mechanisms. This stems from a process of looking at always on-data and relating to random events to uncover meaning from different groups. Matching is one adjustment process that can be made within non-experimental data in regards to groups who receive treatment where cluster similar people in regards to those that are not directly in interest for the treatment. With matching, both the intepretation of results must be looked at from the regards of matched groups alongside considering entities that inherently were not built to be matched due to external factors/circumstances."
